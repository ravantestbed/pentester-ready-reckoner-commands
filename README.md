1. 	FIle Associations
 
You can set the association by typing something like assoc .doc=Word.Document.8.
2.	FC: File Compare
Fc /a File1.txt File2.txt will compare two ascii files.
Fc /b Picture1.jpg Picture2.jpg will do a binary compare on two images.
3. Shutdowna windows system
Typing shutdown /i from the command prompt will initiate a shutdown, but it’ll upon a GUI to give the user an option on whether to restart or do a full shutdown. If you don’t want to have any GUI pop up, you can just issue a shutdown /s command. 
4.	SFC: System File Checker
 

If you’re ever concerned that a virus or some other software might have corrupted your core system files, there’s a Windows command that can scan those files and ensure their integrity.You need to launch CMD as administrator (right click and choose Run as Administrator). Typing SFC /SCANNOW will check the integrity of all protected system files. If a problem is found, the files will be repaired with backed-up system files.
The SFC command also lets you:
    /VERIFYONLY: Check the integrity but don’t repair the files.
    /SCANFILE: Scan the integrity of specific files and fix if corrupted.
    /VERIFYFILE: Verify the integrity of specific files but don’t repair them.
    /OFFBOOTDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline boot directory.
    /OFFWINDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline Windows directory.
    /OFFLOGFILE: Specify a path to save a log file with scan results.

5.	NET USE: Map drives
If you want to map a new drive, you could always open File Explorer, right click on This PC, and go through the Map Network Drive wizard. However, using the NET USE command, you can do the same thing with one command string.
For example, if you have a share folder on a computer on your network called \\OTHER-COMPUTER\SHARE\, you can map this as your own Z: drive by typing the command:
Net use Z: “\\OTHER-COMPUTER\SHARE” /persistent:yes
The persistent switch tells your computer that you want this drive remapped every time you log back into your computer.
6.	SCHTASKS: Schedule Tasks
Windows comes with a wizard for creating scheduled tasks. For example, maybe you have a BAT file stored on C:\temp that you want to run every day at noon.
You’d have to click through the Scheduled Task wizard to configure this. Or you can type a single SCHTASKS command to set it up.
SCHTASKS /Create /SC HOURLY /MO 12 /TR Example /TN c:\temp\File1.bat
The scheduled switch accepts arguments like minute, hourly, daily, and monthly. Then you specify the frequency with the /MO command.
If you typed the command correctly, you’ll see the response, SUCCESS: The scheduled task “Example” has successfully been created.
----------------------------------------
copy SvcHostDemo.dll %SystemRoot%\System32\SvcHostDemo.dll
sc create SvcHostDemo binPath= ^%%SystemRoot^%%"\system32\svchost.exe -k mygroup" type= share start= demand
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\SvcHostDemo\Parameters /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ^%%SystemRoot^%%\System32\SvcHostDemo.dll /f
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost" /v mygroup /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d SvcHostDemo /f
------------------------------------------
7.	ATTRIB: Change File Attributes
In Windows, you can change file attributes by right clicking on a file and finding the right property to change. However, instead of hunting around for the file attribute, you can use the ATTRIB command to set the file attributes.
For example, if you type: ATTRIB +R +H C:\temp\File1.bat, it’ll set File1.bat as a hidden, read-only file.
There is no response when it’s successful, so unless you see an error message, the command worked.

8.    BITSADMIN: Initiate upload or download jobs over the network or internet and monitor the current state of those file transfers.
9.  COLOR: Change the background color of the command prompt window.
10. COMP: Compare the contents of any two files to see the differences.
11.    FIND/FINDSTR: Search for strings inside of any ASCII files.
12.   PROMPT: Change the command prompt from C:\> to something else.
13.    TITLE: Change the title of the command prompt window.
14.   REGEDIT: Edit keys in the Windows registry (use with caution).
 15.   ROBOCOPY: A powerful file copy utility built right into Windows.
